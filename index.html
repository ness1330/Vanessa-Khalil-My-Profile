<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Vanessa Khalil. Nine times out of ten, the first statements that people make when they first meet me is, “You’re not Lebanese.” My response is normally something along the lines of, “well who would have thought, thank you for that information.” In actual fact, my background is Australian with English and Irish born parents and I happened to marry a crazy Palestinian and had a couple of half-crazy Palestinian children (Aleksandar and Amira), hence the Middle Eastern surname. </p>
<p>I have only ever spoken English, however after being married into a Middle Eastern family for 15 years, I have picked up the Arabic language and have learned the basic skill of reading and writing. My children however, are more fluent than me and have picked up the language beautifully. </p>
<p>I am not really that much of an interesting person compared to so many other people around me. However, something that is unique to me is that I do know how to fly a small aircraft. When I was 15 years old, I went on an aeroplane for the first time. As we were flying through the air, I told my parents that I would learn to fly one of these one day. My Dad bought me my first aeroplane lesson for my 16th birthday where I learnt to fly a Cessna 152 (a small two-seater aerobatic plane). My dream one day is to own my own Cessna and teach my kids to fly. </p>
<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
<p>I am Financial Planner for a company in the Gold Coast and due to the changing legalisations with FASEA, in order to continue practicing, I am required to complete a degree in Financial Planning. One of the subjects that was compulsory for me to do is this subject, Information Technology. Initially my thoughts for this subject, were not great. I did say to my boss on one occasion, “I will not be sitting with a client and then ask them if they wanted a website designed with their retirement projections.” However, the more that I have been reading into the subject there has been some interest forming as IT is more than just getting angry at my computer on a daily basis. As technology has been advancing, so has IT. In financial planning world, there is a whole technology sector that investors invest in. Managed Fund Investment Committees base their investment strategies on the ‘disruption of technology’ and ‘tech booms.’ IT surrounds us and as generation after generation progresses so will IT. And whether you are a Financial Planner, a teacher or someone in the medical field, we all need to have a level of understanding of IT. Essentially as we are today, if IT stops, so does the world. </p>

<img src="My ideal Job.png" alt="My Ideal Job">
<p>My ideal job would be working as a Senior Financial Adviser (as described in the job advertisement above), to potentially own my own business or be a partner for an existing Financial Planning Practice. </p>

<p>The job advertised are seeking a Senior Wealth Adviser which is another name for Senior Financial Adviser. </p>

<p>The recruiter is seeking a financial adviser who has extensive experience in wealth management for portfolios that exceed $1million per client. They have stipulated that they would require the financial adviser to have experience in Risk Insurance (this relates to personal insurances such as Life Insurance and Income Protection), SMSF (which is a Self-Managed Super Fund - someone who owns their own super fund as opposed to using a platform like Australian Super. These are usually heavily regulated and must be owned by two individuals such as a Husband and Wife under a corporate trustee). The Financial Adviser must also have experience in providing investment advice such as investing into shares and/or managed funds in the most tax effective manner. </p>

<p>The position is ideal to me as I have experience in the above. Financial Planning is my career and may passion. Not as extensive as the recruiter requires, however that is my goal to work towards. I have no intention to leave my current employer, however this is my ultimate goal. To build up my career to be a Senior Financial Adviser/Wealth Manager. </p>

<p>For me to grow further in my career and reach the level of job description in the job advertisement, I will need further experience. I already have a strong level experience now. It will be all about enhancing my experience. Work more closely with clients, expand my education through different courses and other areas of study. Attend regular conferences and professional developments and expand my client data base in order to experience all different areas of advice. And most importantly, continue to service my existing clients and working along side my boss who will continue to teach me new skills every day. </p>

<h3> Results of the Learning Style Test</h3>

<h4>Your Learning Styles <h4>
                                                                  
<p>Learning Styles is a theory that suggests people learn better using different methods of learning. We perceive information using our senses. The three most practical senses in learning environments are sight, hearing and touch. The VAK model categorizes these sensory methods of learning as Visual (V), Auditory (A) and Kinesthetic (K) learning styles. </p>

<p>While most people have a dominant learning style, nobody has just one learning style. Everyone uses each of the learning styles to some degree. Some are stronger in one style while others have even strength in all styles. The reality is that we all have a custom "learning style" that is, in varying degrees, a combination of Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic learning. </p>

<p>It is useful to know the strength of your learning styles as they relate to each other. This allows you to focus on maximizing your learning potential. Recognizing your strengths also helps you to seek learning opportunities that cater to your combination of learning style strengths. In recent years, many educators have started using knowledge of Learning Styles (and Multiple Intelligences) to improve teaching methods in order to reach learners of all types.</p>
